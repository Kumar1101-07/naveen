    <p>Mr. Vijay introduced the two-coloured flag with red on top and bottom; yellow in the middle; and a flower resembling Vaagai surrounded by 28 stars at the centre with two trumpeting tuskers facing each other on either side. Warriors of ancient Tamil kingdoms wore Vaagai flower garlands to symbolise victory. Mr. Vijay also hoisted the flag at the party’s headquarters and launched the party’s flag song Thamizhan Kodi Parakuthu.</p>
    <P>Addressing the party workers, Mr. Vijay said “I take pride in launching the party’s flag, a symbol of victory for our future generation. So far we worked for ourselves. From now on, we will work together as a party for the welfare of the people of Tamil Nadu.” He said the party’s ideology, principles, action plan and the history behind the party’s flag will be explained during the party’s first State-level conference (the date for which would be announced later). He urged his party workers to get proper permission (from official authorities) and hoist the flag.</P>
